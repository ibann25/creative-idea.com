                    <h1 style="background-color: #996633">User-Centered Evaluation</h1><br>
                    <p>
                        User-centered evaluation is understood as evaluation conducted with methods suited for 
                        the framework of user-centered design as it is described in ISO 13407 (ISO, 1999). Within the framework 
                        of user-centered design, it is typically focused on evaluation the usability (ISO, 1994) of the system, 
                        possibly along with additional evaluations of the users' subjective experiences including factors like 
                        enjoyment and trust (Brandtzæg, Følstad, & Heim, 2002; Egger, 2002; Jordan, 2001; Ljungblad, Skog, & 
                        Holmquist, 2002). User-centered evaluation may also focus on the user experience of a company or service 
                        through all channels of communication. <br><br>
                        
                        User-Centered Evaluation (UCE) is defined as an empirical evaluation obtained by assessing 
                        user performance and user attitudes toward a system, by gathering subjective user feedback on 
                        effectiveness and satisfaction, quality of work, support and training costs or user health and well-being.<br><br>

                        The term user-centered evaluation refers to evaluating the utility and value of software to the intended end-users. 
                        While usability (ease of use of software) is certainly a necessary condition, it is not sufficient.

                <h3>Goals of User-Centered Evaluation (UCE)</h3>

                        <div class="head-topBee">
                                    
                            <p> • User-centered evaluation (UCE) can serve three goals: <br>
                                • supporting decisions<br>
                                • detecting problems <br>
                                • verifying the quality of a product<br>
                            </p>

                        </div> 
                <p> 
                    These functions make UCE a valuable tool for developers of all kinds of systems, because they 
                    can justify their efforts, improve upon a system .

                    <h1 style="background-color: #996633">Heuristic evaluation</h1><br>
                    <p>
                        A heuristic evaluation is a usability inspection method for computer software that helps to 
                        identify usability problems in the user interface (UI) design. It specifically involves evaluators 
                        examining the interface and judging its compliance with recognized usability principles (the "heuristics").
                        <br><br>
                        
                        Heuristic evaluation is a process where experts use rules of thumb to measure the usability of user interfaces 
                        in independent walkthroughs and report issues. Evaluators use established heuristics (e.g., Nielsen-Molich's) 
                        and reveal insights that can help design teams enhance product usability from early in development.
                        <br><br>

                        The Nielsen-Molich heuristics state that a system should: Keep users informed about its status appropriately 
                        and promptly. Show information in ways users understand from how the real world operates, and in the users' 
                        language. Offer users control and let them undo errors easily.

                                When users know the current system status, they learn the outcome of their prior interactions and determine next steps.

                            <h2> The design should speak the users' language. Use words, phrases, and concepts familiar to the user, rather than internal

                                The way you should design depends very much on your specific users. Terms, concepts, icons, and images that seem 
                                perfectly clear to you and your colleagues may be unfamiliar or confusing to your users.<br><br>
                                
                                When a design’s controls follow real-world conventions and correspond to desired outcomes (called natural mapping), 
                                it’s easier for users to learn and remember how the interface works. This helps to build an experience that feels 
                                intuitive.

                                Usability testing refers to evaluating a product or service by testing it with representative users. 
                                Typically, during a test, participants will try to complete typical tasks while observers watch, listen 
                                and takes notes.  The goal is to identify any usability problems, collect qualitative and quantitative 
                                data and determine the participant's satisfaction with the product.<br><br>

                            Usability testing lets the design and development teams identify problems before they are coded. 
                            The earlier issues are identified and fixed, the less expensive the fixes will be in terms of both 
                            staff time and possible impact to the schedule.  During a usability test, you will:

                            The purpose of usability testing is to ensure the plan for a product's functions, features and overall 
                            purpose are in line with what users want by observing how real-life people use the product.<br><br>

                            Usability testing allows you to learn things about user behavior, needs, and expectations upfront.\

                                                a group of more than ten testers, the data collected are more about the quantity than the quality
