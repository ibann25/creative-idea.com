                        <h2>3.) Fitts’ Law </h2>
                        <p>
                            * Predicts how long it will take a user to select a target; used for evaluating device input.
    
                        </p>
                        <p> * Fitts’ Law states that the amount of time required for a person to move a pointer (e.g., mouse cursor)
                            to a target area is a function of the distance to the target divided by the size of the target. Thus, the 
                            longer the distance and the smaller the target’s size, the longer it takes.<br><br>

                            * Fitts’ law is widely applied in user experience (UX) and user interface (UI) design.<br><br>

                            * For example, this law influenced the convention of making interactive buttons large (especially on 
                            finger-operated mobile devices)—smaller buttons are more difficult (and time-consuming) to click. Likewise,
                             the distance between a user’s task/attention area and the task-related button should be kept as short as possible.<br><br>

                            * The law is applicable to rapid, pointing movements, not continuous motion (e.g., drawing). Such movements typically
                              consist of one large motion component (ballistic movement) followed by fine adjustments to acquire (move over) the target.
                               The law is particularly important in visual interface design—or any interface involving pointing (by finger or mouse, etc.)

                                     style. Designers aim to create interfaces which users find easy to use and pleasurable. UI design refers to graphical user interfaces 
                                     and other forms—e.g., voice-controlled interfaces.<br><br>

                                    Abbreviated as CLI, a Command Line Interface connects a user to a computer program or operating system. 
                                    Through the CLI, users interact with a system or application by typing in text (commands). The command 
                                    is typed on a specific line following a visual prompt from the computer.<br><br>
           
                                    Advantages: This type of interface needs much less memory (RAM) in order to use compared to other types of user interfaces.<br><br>
                                    Disadvantages: Commands have to be typed precisely. If there is a spelling error the command will fail.

                                        The menu-driven user interface provides you with a range of commands or options in the form of a list or menu displayed in 
                                        full-screen, pop-up, pull-down, or drop-down. An ATM is an example of a menu-driven interface. Advantages: It is not necessary

                                        A GUI (graphical user interface) is a system of interactive visual components for computer software. 
                                        A GUI displays objects that convey information, and represent actions that can be taken by the user. 
                                        The objects change color, size, or visibility when the user interacts with them.<br><br>
            
                                     Advantages: Visually appealing design.<br>Even users with little technical knowledge can run simple applications with a GUI.<br><br>
                                     Disadvantages: System functionality cannot be adjusted or adapted.<br>GUIs need a relatively high amount of storage space in the system.

                                        A touchscreen GUI is a graphical user interface operated by fingertips or a stylus. This can be a PC or laptop or on a handheld 
                                        device like a tablet. Touchscreen GUIs are becoming increasingly commonplace in medical settings and offer a range of benefits 
                                        to health care professionals and patients alike<br><br>
            
                                     Advantages: Most touch screens are fixed to a larger device so there is less chance of them being removed, lost or stolen (unlike keyboards).<br><br>
                                     Disadvantages: The screen could become scratched or dirty so it is difficult to see the options available.

                <h2>1.) Anthropomorphic Approach</h2>
                <p> * The anthropomorphic approach to human-computer interaction involves designing a user interface to possess human-like qualities. 
                    <br><br>
    
                    * For instance, an interface may be designed to communicate with users in a human-to-human manner, as if the computer empathizes 
                    with the user. Interface error messaging in often written this way, such as, “We’re sorry, but that page cannot be found.”

                            <p>•  Affordances</p>
                            <p>
                                Human affordances are perceivable potential actions that a person can do with an object. In terms of HCI, icons, 
                                folders, and buttons afford mouse-clicking, scrollbars afford sliding a button to view information off-screen, 
                                and drop-down menus show the user a list of options from which to choose.  Similarly, pleasant sounds are used 
                                to indicate when a task has completed, signalling that the user may continue with the next step in a process.<br><br>

                                Examples of this are notifications of calendar events, new emails, and the completion of a file transfer.

                            </p>
                            <p>•  Constraints</p>
                            <p>
                                Constraints complement affordances by indicating the limitations of user actions. A grayed-out menu option and 
                                an unpleasant sound (sometimes followed by an error message) indicate that the user cannot carry out a particular 
                                action. <br><br>
                                Affordances and constraints can be designed to non-verbally guide user behaviors through an interface and 
                                prevent user errors in a complex interface.

                    order to develop a user interface that will support the end user.

                    <h3>Three Elements of Cognitive Approach:</h3>
    
                    <div class="head-topBee">

                        <p>•  Metaphoric Design</p>
                        <p>
                            Using metaphors can be an effective way to communicate an abstract concept or procedure to users, as long as the 
                            metaphor is used accurately. Computers use a “desktop” metaphor to represent data as document files, folders, and 
                            applications.<br><br>

                            Metaphors rely on a user’s familiarity with another concept, as well as human affordances, to help users understand 
                            the actions they can perform with their data based on the form it takes. For instance, a user can move a file or 
                            folder into the “trashcan” to delete it.

                        </p>
                        <p>•  Attention and Workload Models</p>
                        <p>
                            When designing an interface to provide good usability, it is important to consider the user’s attention span, which 
                            may be based on the environment of use, and the perceived mental workload involved in completing a task.  Typically, 
                            users can focus well on one-task-at-a-time.<br><br>

                           For example, when designing a web-based form to collect information from a user, it is best to contextually collect 
                           information separately from other information. The form may be divided into “Contact Information” and “Billing Information”, 
                           rather than mixing the two and confusing users.
                        </p>
                        <p>•  Human Information Processing Model</p>
                        <p>
                            Human Information Processing (HIP) Theory describes the flow of information from the world, into the human mind, and back 
                            into the world. When a human pays attention to something, the information first gets encoded based on the sensory system 
                            that channeled the information (visual, auditory, haptic, etc.).<br><br>

                            Next, the information moves into Working Memory, formerly known as Short-Term memory. Working Memory can hold a limited 
                            amount of information for up to approximately 30 seconds. Repeating or rehearsing information may increase this duration. 
                            After Working Memory, the information may go into Long-Term Memory or simply be forgotten. Long-Term Memory is believed 
                            to be unlimited, relatively permanent memory storage.

                 <h2>3.) Empirical Approach</h2>

                 <p> * The empirical approach to HCI is useful for examining and comparing the usability of multiple conceptual designs. This testing 
                     may be done during pre-production by counterbalancing design concepts and conducting usability testing on each design concept. 
                     Often, users will appreciate specific elements of each design concept, which may lead to the development of a composite conceptual 
                     design to test.

                            In addition to a qualitative assessment of user preferences for a conceptual design, measuring users’ task performance is 
                            important for determining how intuitive and user-friendly a web page is.  A researcher who is familiar with the tasks the 
                            web page has been designed to support will develop a set of test tasks that relate to the task goals associated with the 
                            page. <br><br>

                            If two of three design concepts were rated highly during user testing, it may be advantageous to conduct an A/B Test during 
                            post-production.<br><br>

                      efficiently complete a goal. GOMS is an acronym that stands for Goals, Operators, Methods, and Selection Rules (Card, Moran,

                            <br><br>
                            An action performed in service of a goal; can be perceptual, cognitive or motor acts.

                          <p>•  Methods </p>
                          <p>
                            Are procedures that include a series of operators and sub-goals that the user employs to accomplish a goal.  
                            <br><br>
                            Sequences of operators and sub goal invocations that accomplish a specified goal.

                          <p>•  Selection Rules </p>
                          <p>
                            Refer to a user’s personal decision about which method will work best in a particular situation in order to reach a goal. 
                            <br><br>
                            Represent the user’s knowledge of which method should be applied.

                      * The GOMS model is based on human information processing theory, and certain measurements of human performance are used to 
                      calculate the time it takes to complete a goal.<br><br>

                      * For example, the average time it takes a human to visually fixate on a web page, move eye fixation to another part of the 
                      web page, cognitively process information, and make a decision of what to do next can be measured in milliseconds.<br><br>
