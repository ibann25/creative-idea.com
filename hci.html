            <p>
                The definition of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) needs to remain quite broad, as it now covers almost all forms of information technology (IT).1 HCI is
                 the study of designing computers and machines so that they best serve their users (i.e. humans). HCI is closely related to the field of User Experience (UX)
                design and is considered by many to be the forefather of this more modern approach.2<br><br>

                Despite this common link, HCI differs from the more widely-recognised UX design in that its main focus is academic. Where UX designers will be charged with 
                building new human-focused applications, products or services, HCI practitioners are more concerned with the research. This means HCI is focused mainly on developing
                empirical understandings of users, which can then help to inform the work of on-the-ground UX designers.3 That’s why HCI is the window through which the future of UX 
                can be seen.<br><br>
                
                Human Computer Interaction (HCI) is the study, design and implementation of software to be used directly with general individuals. 
                These systems are called a ‘User Interface’ (UI, this is how a human will interact with a computer. HCI doesn’t simply concern just 
                the design of a GUI or creating simplistic menu screens, it also focuses on the specific functionality of the computers and the role 
                they play alongside human beings.

            <p> * The user interface must be created in a way of which can be simple enough for anyone to use without assistance.<br><br>

                * The interface may or may not be created with one particular purpose in mind. This means that an interfaces is rarely created with exact detail specifically<br>
                  made to one individual's preference or needs.

                        <p>
                            Colour combinations are vital to ensure an easy and fun use for the user of the UI or at least a somewhat standard experience (overall positive).
                            The combination of colour is much more important than just providing an attractive UI, it also can play a role in the effectivity of the UI. 
                            For example, colour coding. Should the UI display a map of the area surrounding the O2 Arena, it might display restaurants, toilets, shops
                             and other facilities.

                            <p>
                                 Luminance is a specific system of colours that provide an overall better visual effect, making it easier to see, therefore it should really be applied with multiple contrasts.
                                 In particular, the Trichromatic system (For example RGB), three colours with different levels of implementation to obtain different colours. On a scientific level,
                                  this colour system is detectable by 3 cells in the human retina (called receptors).

                                Pattern is just the template that is used by the UI designer. The pattern will set out the structure of the UI, where all the text and graphics will go. By keeping a similar 
                                structure or one that resembles that of mainstream UI’s, it will make the UI seem much more familiar with new users, allowing them to pick it up much faster. 
                                The best example of this would of course be Windows and each version of their OS.

                            <p>
                                This effect is a clever technique designed to cause the eyes of the user to direct towards particular items on the UI. This is mostly used in media or 
                                advertising, but for our case, it is simply used to attract the user towards the most important items, such as a menu or search bar. A good example 
                                would be the old power settings on the Windows XP OS. By using a pop-out effect and a clever colour scheme, it was easy to figure out what each of the 
                                buttons did.

                            •	Figure and Ground - These explain how we piece together elements of a visual which appear to be similar in shape or appearance
                             and group them together as a whole. Similar elements are contrasted with dissimilar elements to give the visual effect of a whole. 
                             (Figure being similar elements and ground being dissimilar elements.<br><br>
                             •	Similarity - This principle details that when we perceive things, the shared features of these elements such as shape, colour, 
                             value, size, texture or or angle (orientation) will associate within our minds. <br><br>
                             •	Proximity - This states that when we view entities that are close together, we associate them as belonging together or relating 
                             in some way.<br><br>
                             •	Continuity - This explains the way in which we perceive items that appear to conjoin, as just single entities. 
                             (Like how we perceive a cross to be two lines rather than four meeting in the centre.<br><br>
                             •	Closure - This explains that we will often be presented with unfinished information and either just understand
                             it to be complete, or auto-complete it in our head.<br><br>
                             •	Area - This states we often view overlapping shapes of smaller area as a figure and one of larger area as ground.
                              However, this effect can be reversed using shading.<br><br>
                              •	Symmetry - This final principle describes the way that most people would perceive one whole figure rather than
                               the separate elements used to build up the figure.

            <h2>2. Behavioural Model </h2>
            <p>
                * A Behavioural Model is a model or template which is often used in order to produce a brand new device or UI. By borrowing elements 
                from existing and recognisable models a designer can greatly reduce the time needed to produce plans or consider large amounts of 
                factors. Behavioural models are built with the core basis being adaptability. The model allows you to implement a newly designed
                interface with new or existing variables and produce reliable results on it’s functionality. These models, in particular, specify
                on human behaviour around the device with the UI implemented. Behaviour models can be split into two separate categories, Predictive 
                models and Descriptive models. Tables can be found below detailing each in their respective order.

                                <p>

                                    This particular model was first devised in 1980 by Car, Newell and Moran. It’s purpose is to predict practical design tasks,
                                     ommonly text based tasks. The model was able to predict how long the average user would take to complete simple text modification
                                    tasks. The model is built upon a simple set of commands that have a predetermined average time expectancy for amount of time need 
                                    to carry the task out. These commands would require a formula. A formula of which would consist of the times for multiple commands.
                                    <br><br>
                                    For example, if the user needed to input the word ‘cat’, the model would know that on average it would take the user 3.147 seconds to 
                                    input this data. The 3.147 would be comprised of the time taken to press each key. (c=1.049, a=1.049 and t=1.049). So c+a+t =3.147. 
                                    However, the model has a bad flaw. It was unable to comprehend human error, so should a human create an error in the submitted task, 
                                    the model would fail to incorporate this into its prediction. meaning it wouldn’t take into consideration the time it takes to press 
                                    backspace and then the correct key.
                                </p>

                                <p>

                                    (This works a lot like a lightgate in physics) This model is used to determine how long it takes for data to travel between two specific
                                     points. This is commonly used when transferring data from say a drive to a network. An algorithm would be used to calculate the length 
                                     of time needed to transfer data from one location to another.
                                     <br><br>
                                    This algorithm would look somewhat like this, Data Size/Transfer Speed. To put it simply, bits/seconds, or bits per second.

                                <p>

                                    Fitt’s law is a model simply designed to predict the time it would take for the average human to interact with the computer. For example,
                                    the time it would take for you to move your mouse from one end of the screen to another, or the time it would take to type out each letter 
                                    of the alphabet in order. The purpose of this model is to predict exactly how effective a particular form of HCI is and the average time for
                                    a human to carry out a specific set of actions. This model is hugely important within the community of HCI’s as it’s results are able to provide
                                    clear improvements to the HCI and lead to more effective builds in the future.

                                    The best example for this is PC gamers. The majority use what is termed as a ‘WASD’ controls. This refers to the keys that determine the direction of
                                    movement in the game. However, some play with the arrow keys instead. This is an example of two different groups using different keys but expecting the same outcome.

                                    <p>•	Executive - This defines keys that carry out specific functions like the F1-12 keys or the enter key.</p>
                                    <p>•	Modifier - These keys don’t do either of the above, but instead modify the action of other keys, for example, holding shift+4 will produce a $ symbol.</p>

                                <p>

                                    The Three state model is used to describe the ease of mouse (or mouse wheel) mobility and will measure how much pressure the individuals apply
                                    to it. It also gathers information on the speed and dexterity of its movement.

                                    <p>•	Tracking - Used to monitor where the user moves things around the screen such as the cursor.</p>
                                    <p>•	Dragging - Checking the time it takes the user to move one file from point a to b.</p>

                                <p>3.) Guiard’s Model of Bimanual Skill</p>
                                <p>

                                    This is perhaps the most simple of all the models, it just describes how often people divide hand operated tasks between a
                                    certain hand. For example, 90% of individuals write with their right hand, but some can do both and 10% use the left. But
                                    typing is different as most use two hands on the keyboard. The basis of the model is to specify how often we’ll separate
                                    which hand we use for specific tasks. Most don’t even give it a thought before they type, but it is largely down to which
                                    hand is closest to the desired key.  But it is important as after all, we don’t really decide, it’s just instinct to use whichever
                                    hand, we don’t sit and decide each time, our hands just go.

            <!-----------------Shneiderman's 8 Golden Rules------------->

            <h2>3. Shneiderman's 8 Golden Rules</h2>

            <p>* These 8 ‘golden rules’ were derived from a publication titled, “Designing the User Interface” by Ben Shneiderman. Shneiderman collated many core
                ideas and principles which he had come to after his long history with working alongside UI’s. These ideas can be applied to any and all successful
                user interfaces.
            </p>
                <div class="head-topBee">
                    <h3>Below is each of the ‘Golden Rules’:</h3>

                    <div class="head-topBe">
                                
                        <p> 1.)	Strive for consistency </p>
                        <p>

                            Consistent sequences of action should always be required in similar situations; coherent terminology should be used throughout
                            prompts, menus and assistance screens and most importantly consistent commands should be used throughout. 

                        </p>
                        <p> 2.)	Enable frequent users to use shortcuts  </p>
                        <p>

                            As the user users the UI more, they begin to want to shorten the amount of processes needed to access the information or software
                            that they want to access. Macro bindings, shortcut keys and hidden commands are a perfect way to achieve this.

                        </p>
                        <p> 3.)	Offer informative feedback  </p>
                        <p>

                            For every action, there should be some way for some system feedback.

                        </p>
                        <p> 4.)	Design dialogue to yield closure  </p>
                        <p>

                            Sequences of actions must be organised into groups with a beginning, middle and end. The user needs to feel a sense of satisfaction
                            or accomplishment, something to make the user drop any further plans of contingency within the UI from their minds, an indication to
                            show that the path is clear to prepare for the next group of actions. 

                        </p>
                        <p> 5.)	Offer simple error handling  </p>
                        <p>

                            Make the UI able to withstand even the most basic of people, make sure it has no way of causing any serious error. (Such as disallowing
                            the user to input numerical values in a box that asks for a name).

                        </p>
                        <p> 6.)	Permit easy reversal of actions </p>
                        <p>

                            This will alleviate most feeling of anxiety when presented with new UI and will help to promote exploration of the UI’s capabilities,
                            allowing the user to find more enjoyment from it. This can be implemented easily by the addition of a back arrow or simply using the
                            shortcut ‘CTRL+Z’. 

                        </p>
                        <p> 7.)	Support internal locus of control </p>
                        <p>

                            experienced users of a UI strongly feel the sense that they are in full control of the UI. This confidence allows them to get on with the
                            UI better, for new users, they do not feel this same feeling of confidence. The best way to give them it is to make them feel like they’re
                            the sole operator and they fully control the whole UI.

                        </p>
                        <p> 8.)	Reduce short-term memory load </p>
                        <p>

                            Human memory should always be regarded with UI. If getting to a key feature requires any more than 3 processes, it should really have a
                            shortcut as it can become hard to remember each process for each path.

                        </p>
