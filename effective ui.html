                <p> 
                    User Interface (UI) Design focuses on anticipating what users might need to do and ensuring that the 
                    interface has elements that are easy to access, understand, and use to facilitate those actions. UI 
                    brings together concepts from interaction design, visual design, and information architecture.

                                        Prototyping is another type of software engineering models that can have a complete range of

                                        In HCI, prototyping is a trial and partial design that helps users in testing design ideas 
                                        without executing a complete system.<br><br>

                                            Prototyping is an experimental process where design teams implement ideas into tangible forms from 
                                            paper to digital. Teams build prototypes of varying degrees of fidelity to capture design concepts 
                                            and test on users. With prototypes, you can refine and validate your designs so your brand can release 
                                            the right products.
